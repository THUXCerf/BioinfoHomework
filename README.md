### 1. Global Alignment

#### Input: 

Enter the two sequences you want to process the global alignment behond the prompts. For example,

​	‘ACTC’, ‘ACC’

And the scoring values were already set to 1, -1, -1.

#### Output:

The score of the global alignment and the alignment result of the two inputs. For example,

​	The global alignment score is 2

​	The alignment result is 

​	Seq1:   ACTC

​	Seq2:   AC-C



Get the detail implement in ***Global Alignment.py***. 



### 2. Longest Common Sequence (LCS)

#### The original input:

Read from the LongestCommonSeq.txt, recognize the implict ‘\n’, divide the txt into two or more sequences.

#### Final Output:

As for the homework attachment, the length of the sequence 1 and sequence 2 are both 10000, and the LCS is: 

***Bioinformatics is the application of information technology to the field of molecular biology. The term bioinformatics was coined by Paulien Hogeweg in 1979 for the study of informatic processes in biotic systems. Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data. Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. It is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes. Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing DNA and protein sequences, aligning different DNA and protein sequences to compare them and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.***

And the Length of the LCS is ***1015***.
